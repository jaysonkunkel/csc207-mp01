Mini Project 1: Classical Encryption
Members: Jayson Kunkel
This submission contains the CaeserCipher and VigenereCipher classes for the first mini project.
Resources: java google style guide -- I referenced the style guide when formatting comments and function headers.
           java String class documentation -- I used several functions from the String class and referenced its documentation.
           StackOverflow -- I referenced StackOverflow early in development when I was figuring out the casting of ints to chars and vice versa.
