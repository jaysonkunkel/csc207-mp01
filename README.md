Mini Project 1: Classical Encryption

Members: Jayson Kunkel

This submission contains the CaeserCipher class, which encodes/decodes a String based on a given key, and the VigenereCipher class, which encodes/decodes a String based on a given keyword.

Resources: java google style guide -- I referenced the style guide when formatting comments and function headers.
           java String class documentation -- I used several functions from the String class and referenced its documentation.
           StackOverflow -- I referenced StackOverflow early in development when I was figuring out the casting of ints to chars and vice versa.
